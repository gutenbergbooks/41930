<h2><a name="MR_COLLIERS_PREFACE" id="MR_COLLIERS_PREFACE">[MR COLLIER'S PREFACE.]</a></h2>

<p>Considering the celebrity that Nathaniel Field has acquired in
consequence of his connection with Massinger in writing "The Fatal
Dowry," it is singular that the two plays in which he was unaided by any
contemporary dramatist should not yet have been reprinted, if only to
assist the formation of a judgment as to the probable degree of
Massinger's obligation. "A Woman is a Weathercock" and its sequel,
"Amends for Ladies," are the productions of no ordinary poet. In comic
scenes Field excels Massinger, who was not remarkable for his success in
this department of the drama; and in those of a serious character he may
be frequently placed on a footing of equality.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Reed was of opinion that Field the actor was not the same person who
joined Massinger in "The Fatal Dowry," and who wrote the two plays above
mentioned; but the discovery of Henslowe's MSS. shows that they were
intimately connected in authorship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> misfortune. The joint
letter of Nathaniel Field, Rob. Daborne, and Philip Massinger to
Henslowe, soliciting a small loan to relieve them from temporary
imprisonment, has been so often republished (see Malone's Shakespeare,
by Boswell, iii. 337) that it is unnecessary to repeat it here.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Field, who penned the whole body of the letter, speaks in it of himself,
both as an author and as an actor. It is without date, and Malone
conjectured that it was written between 1612 and 1615. But from the
Dedication to "A Woman is a Weathercock," we should conclude that in
1612 Field was not distressed for money. He there tells "any woman that
hath been no weathercock" that he "cared not for forty shillings," the
sum then usually given by the person to whom the play was inscribed.
This assertion, perhaps, was only a vain boast, while the fact might be,
either that he could not get anybody to patronise "so fameless a pen,"
or that, although he might not just at that moment be in want of "forty
shillings," he might stand in need of it very soon afterwards, according
to the customary irregular mode of living of persons of his pursuits and
profession.</p>

<p>It might be inferred from a passage in the address
"to the Reader," that "A Woman is a Weathercock"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>was written some time before it was printed; and from the dedication of
the same play, we learn that Field's "Amends for Ladies," if not then
also finished, was fully contemplated by the author under that title. An
allusion to the Gunpowder Treason of 1605 is made in the first act of "A
Woman is a Weathercock;" but it could not have been produced so early.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Field was originally one of the Children of Queen Elizabeth's
Chapel. Malone tells us that he played in "Cynthia's Revels" in 1601;
but we have it on the authority of Ben Jonson himself, in the folio of
1616, that that "comical satire" was acted in 1600. In 1601 Field
performed in "The Poetaster," and in 1608 he appeared in "Epicæne,"
which purports to have been represented by the "Children of her
Majesty's Revels," for so those of Queen Elizabeth's Chapel were then
called. In 1600 Field was, perhaps, one of the younger children, for in
1609 all the names of the company but his own were changed, many no
doubt having outgrown their situations. He was, therefore, evidently a
very young man when he published his "Woman is a Weathercock" in 1612.
Only one edition of it is known, but "Amends for Ladies" was twice
published by the same stationer, viz., in 1618 and 1639. Mr Gifford
conjectured very reasonably that Field had assisted Massinger in writing
"The Fatal Dowry" before 1623.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He belonged to the Blackfriars
company, and Fleckno speaks of him as a performer of great
distinction.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> According to the portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in Dulwich College, he had rather a feminine look, and early in his
career undertook female parts, which he afterwards abandoned, and
obtained much celebrity as the hero of Chapman's "Bussy d'Ambois,"
originally brought out in 1607. In a prologue to the edition of 1641,
Field is spoken of as the player "whose action <em class="italic">first</em> did give it
name." It has also been supposed that he was dead in 1641, because in
the same prologue, it is asserted "Field is gone," but the expression is
equivocal. The probability seems to be that he quitted the profession
early, and in the address to "A Woman is a Weathercock," he gives a hint
that he will only be heard of in it "for a year or two, and no more."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"Amends for Ladies" will be found, on the whole, a superior performance
to "A Woman is a Weathercock," and if the order of merit only had been
consulted, it ought to have been first reprinted in this collection.</p>

<p>I did determine not to have dedicated my play to anybody, because forty
shillings I care not for!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and above few or none will bestow on these
matters, especially falling from so fameless a pen as mine is yet. And
now I look up, and find to whom my dedication is, I fear I am as good as
my determination: notwithstanding, I leave a liberty to any lady or
woman, that dares say she hath been no weathercock, to assume the title
of patroness to this my book. If she have been constant, and be so, all
I will expect from her for my pains is that she will continue so but
till my next play be printed, wherein she shall see what amends I have
made to her and all the sex,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and so I end my epistle without a Latin
sentence.</p>

<h2><a name="TO_THE_READER" id="TO_THE_READER">TO THE READER.</a></h2>

<p>Reader, the saleman swears you'll take it very ill, if I say not
something to you too. In troth, you are a stranger to me: why should I
write to you? you never writ to me, nor I think will not answer my
epistle. I send a comedy to you here, as good as I could then make; nor
slight my presentation, because it is a play; for I tell thee, reader,
if thou be'st ignorant, a play is not so idle a thing as thou art, but a
mirror of men's lives and actions; nor, be it perfect or imperfect, true
or false, is the vice or virtue of the maker. This is yet, as well as I
can, <i xml:lang="la">qualis ego vel Cluvienus</i>. Thou must needs have some other
language than thy mother-tongue, for thou think'st it impossible for me
to write a play, that did not use a word of Latin, though he had enough
in him. I have been vexed with vile plays myself a great while, hearing
many; now I thought to be even with some, and they should hear mine too.
Fare thee well: if thou hast anything to say to me, thou know'st where
to hear of me for a year or two, and no more, I assure thee.</p>

<p>Let me see, who shall I get now to set it to a
dumpish note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> In good faith, I do not know; but nobody that is wise, I am sure of
that. It will be an excellent matter sung to the knacking of the tongs.
But to my business. God save thee, worthy and right worshipful Sir
Abraham! what, musing and writing? O, this love will undo us all, and
that made me prevent love, and undo myself. But what news of Mistress
Lucida? ha! will she not come off, nor cannot you come on, little
Abraham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> Faith, I have courted her, and courted her; and she does, as
everybody else does, laughs at all I can do or say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Laughs; why that's a sign she is pleased. Do you not know, when a
woman laughs, she's pleased?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> Ay, but she laughs most shamefully and most scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Scornfully! hang her, she's but a bauble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> She's the fitter for my turn, sir; for they will not stick to say,
I am a fool, for all I am a knight.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Love has made you witty, little Nab; but what a mad villain art
thou, a striker, a fiftieth part of Hercules, to get one wench with
child, and go a-wooing to another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> With child! a good jest, i' faith: whom have I got with child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Why, Mistress Wagtail is with child, and will be deposed 'tis
yours. She is my kinswoman, and I would be loth our house should suffer
any disgrace in her; if there be law in England, which there should be,
if we may judge by their consciences, or if I have any friends, the
wench shall take no wrong. I cannot tell: I think my lord will stick to
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> D'ye hear? talk not to me of friends, law, or conscience: if your
kinswoman say she is with child by me, your kinswoman is an errant
whore. Od's will, have you nobody to put your gulls upon but knights?
That Wagtail is a whore, and I'll stand to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Nay, you have stood to it already. But to call my cousin whore! you
have not a mind to have your throat cut, ha' you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> Troth, no great mind, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> But will you fight in this quarrel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> I am resolved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Heart! I have pulled an old house over my head: here's like to be a
tall fray. I perceive a fool's valianter than a knave at all times.
Would I were well rid of him: I had as lief meet Hector, God knows, if
he dare fight at all: they are all one to me; or, to speak more
modernly, with one of the roaring boys.<br />
<span class="alignright">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> Have you done your prayers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Pray give me leave, sir: put up, an't please
you. Are you sure my cousin Wagtail is a whore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> With sword in hand I do it not recant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Well, it shall never be said Jack Pendant would venture his blood
in a whore's quarrel. But, whore or no whore, she is most desperately in
love with you: praises your head, your face, your nose, your eyes, your
mouth: the fire of her commendations makes the pot of your good parts
run over; and to conclude, if the whore have you not, I think the pond
at Islington will be her bathing-tub, and give an end to mortal misery.
But if she belie you&mdash;&mdash;pray, put up, sir; she is an errant
whore, and so let her go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abra.</span> Does she so love me, say you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen.</span> Yes, yes: out of all question, the whore
does love you abominable.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p>This excellent old comedy seems to have been deservedly popular on its
performance by two different companies at the Black Friars Theatre
before 1618, and it was twice printed. It is not easy to decide whether
the comic or the serious scenes are the best; although the first are not
without some of the coarseness which belonged to the manners of the age.
The language is generally well-chosen. Some passages are of the higher
order of poetry, and from them we may judge that Field was capable of
writing other parts of "The Fatal Dowry" than those which Mr Gifford, in
his just admiration of Massinger, was willing to assign to him. The
characters are numerous, varied, and well-distinguished.</p>

<p>The object of the play was to vindicate the female sex, attacked in
"Woman is a Weathercock;" and it is accomplished amply and happily in
the persons of the Maid, Wife, and Widow. The plot is threefold,
applying to each of them, but the incidents are interwoven with
ingenuity, and concluded without confusion. In several of our old plays,
husbands become, or endeavour to become, the instruments of the
dishonour of their wives. Middleton was too fond of incidents of this
odious kind, which are to be found in his "Chaste Maid in Cheapside,"
1630, and in "Anything for a Quiet Life," 1662;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> but in both cases
the purpose of the husband was to profit by his own disgrace. In <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Field's "Amends for Ladies," the husband only resorts to this expedient
to put his wife's fidelity to the test. This portion of the play was
borrowed, in several of its preliminary circumstances, from the novel of
the "Curioso Impertinente" in "Don Quixote;" but it would not have
accorded with Field's design of making amends to the fair sex that
Subtle should have met with the same success as Lothario. The attempt of
Bold in disguise upon the Widow was taken from an incident apparently
well known about the date when the play was written, and referred to in
it. The original of that part of the comedy which relates to Ingen and
the Lady Honour has not been found, and perhaps it was the invention of
the poet.</p>

<p>The two editions of this play in 1618 and 1639 do not materially vary,
although the difference between the title-pages might lead to the
supposition that "the merry pranks of Moll Cutpurse" and the "humour of
roaring" were new in the latter copy. It seldom happens that faith is to
be put in attractive changes of title-pages. Middleton and Rowley's
"Fair Quarrel" is, indeed, an instance to the contrary; for the edition
of 1622 contains a good deal of curious matter connected with the
manners of the times, promised in "the fore-front of the book," and not
found in the copy of 1617. In "Amends for Ladies," Moll Cutpurse only
appears in one scene. The variations between the impressions are errors
of the press, some of which are important of their kind, and such as
rendered a careful collation absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>It may here, perhaps, be worth while to place in one view the scanty and
scattered information regarding Mary Frith (<em class="italic">alias</em> Moll Cutpurse), the
Roaring Girl. She was a woman who commonly dressed like a man, and
challenged several male opponents, bearing, during her life, the
character of a bully, a thief, a bawd, a receiver of stolen goods,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> She appears to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> the daughter of a
shoemaker, born in 1584, dead in 1659, and buried in what is now called
St Bride's Church. In February 1611-12, she did penance at Paul's Cross,
but the letter mentioning this fact, which is in the British Museum,
does not state for what offence. Among other daring exploits, she
robbed, or assisted in robbing, General Fairfax on Hounslow Heath, for
which she was sent to Newgate, but afterwards liberated without trial.
The immediate cause of her death was a dropsy, and she seems then to
have been possessed of property. She lived in her own house in Fleet
Street, next the Globe Tavern, and left £20 that the conduit might run
wine on the expected return of Charles II. Besides the comedy by
Middleton and Dekker [printed in the works of Middleton], John Day wrote
"a book of the mad pranks of Merry Moll of the Bankside." It was entered
at Stationers' Hall in 1610, and perhaps the play of which she is the
heroine was founded upon it. Another account of her life was printed in
1662, shortly after her decease. She is supposed to be alluded to by
Shakespeare in "Twelfth Night," act i. sc. 3, and obtained such "bad
eminence," in point of notoriety, that it is not surprising (according
to the evidence of the authors of "The Witch of Edmonton," act v. sc.
1), that some of the dogs at Paris Garden, used in baiting bulls and
bears, were named after her.</p>

blind dame that hath cast her blear eyes hitherto upon my occasions may
turn her wheel, and at last wind them up with her white hand to some
pinnacle that prosperously may flourish in the sunshine of promotion.</p>

beauty with content. As for these frumping gallants, let them do their
worst. It is not in man's power to hurt me. 'Tis well known I come not
to be scoffed. A woman may bear and bear, till her back burst. I am a

poverty, I set the hare's head unto the goose giblets, and what I want
one way, I hope I shall be enabled to supply the other.</p>

my last service to believe men's oaths, but I hope my example, though
prejudicial to myself, will be beneficial to other young gentlewomen in

now&mdash;Master Bold), having often attempted my honour, but finding it
impregnable, vowed love and marriage to me at the last. I, a young thing
and raw, being seduced, set my mind upon him, but friends contradicting
the match, I fell into a grievous consumption; and upon my first
recovery, lest the intended sacred ceremonies of nuptials should
succeed, his sister, knowing this, thought it fit in her judgment we
should be farther asunder, and so put me out of her service.</p>

fancy, I will purge it by speech: the less will remain within. A pox of
these nice-mouthed creatures! I have seen a narrow pair of lips utter as
broad a tale as can be bought for money. Indeed, an ill tale unuttered
is like a maggot in a nut, it spoils the whitest kernel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> You speak most intelligently, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Hast not done yet? Thou art an old fumbler, I perceive. Methinks
thou dost not do things like a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Madam, I do my endeavour, and the best can do no more; they that
could do better, it may be would not, and then 'twere all one. But
rather than be a burthen to your ladyship, I protest sincerely, I would
beg my bread; therefore I beseech you, madam, to hold me excused, and
let my goodwill stand for the action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Let thy goodwill stand for the action? If goodwill would do it,
there's many a lady in this land would be content with her old lord; and
thou <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> canst not be a burthen to me, without thou lie upon me,
and that were preposterous in thy sex. Take no exceptions at what I say.
Remember you said <em class="italic">stand</em> even now. There was a word for one of your
coat, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> I swear, madam, you are very merry. God send you good luck. Has
your ladyship no waters that you use at bedtime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> No, in troth, Princox.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> No complexion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> None but mine own, I swear. Didst thou ever use any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> No, indeed, madam; now and then a piece of scarlet, or so; a
little white and red ceruse; but, in troth, madam, I have an excellent
receipt for a nightmask as ever you heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Boar's grease one ounce; Jordan almonds, blanched and ground, a
quartern; red rosewater, half a pint; mare's urine, newly covered, half
a score drops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Fogh! no more of thy medicine, if thou lovest me. Few of our
knights-errant, when they meet a fair lady-errant in a morning, would
think her face had lain so plastered all night. Thou hast had some
apothecary to thy sweetheart. But, leaving this face-physic (for, by my
troth, it may make others have good ones, but it makes me a scurvy one),
which of all the gallants in the town wouldst thou make a husband of, if
thou mightst have him for thy choosing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> In troth, madam, but you'll say I speak blindly, but let my love
stand aside&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> I think it not fit, indeed, your love should stand in the middle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> I say, Master Bold. O, do but mark him, madam; his leg, his hand,
his body, and all his members stand in print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Out upon thee, Princox! No. Methinks Welltried's a handsome fellow.
I like not these starched gallants: masculine faces and masculine
gestures please me best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> How like you Master Pert?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Fie upon him! when he is in his scarlet clothes, he looks like a
man of wax, and I had as lief have a dog o' wax: I do not think but he
lies in a case o' nights. He walks as if he were made of gins<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>&mdash;as
if Nature had wrought him in a frame: I have seen him sit discontented a
whole play, because one of the purls of his band was fallen out of his
reach to order again.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Why, Bold, madam, is clean contrary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Ay, but that's as ill: each extreme is alike vicious; his careful
carelessness is his study. He spends as much time to make himself
slovenly, as the other to be spruce. His garters hang over upon the
calves of his legs, his doublet unbuttoned, and his points untrussed;
his hair in's eyes like a drunkard, and his hat, worn on the<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> hinder-part
of his head, as if he cared more for his memory than his wit, makes him
look as if he were distracted. Princox, I would have you lie with me: I
do not love to lie alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> With all my heart, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Are you clean-skinned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Clean-skinned, madam? there's a question! do you think I have the
itch? I am an Englishwoman: I protest, I scorn the motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Nay, prythee, Princox, be not angry: it's a sign of honesty, I can
tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Faith, madam, I think 'tis but simple honesty that dwells at the
sign of the scab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wid.</span> Well, well, come to bed, and we'll talk further of all these
matters.<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Drawer.</span> Gentlemen, I beseech you consider where you are&mdash;Turnbull

Master Whorebang, Master Bots, Master Tearchaps, and Master Spillblood,

<p><span class="smcap">Drawer.</span> Why, what d'ye think of me? am I an infidel, a Turk, a pagan, a

<p><span class="smcap">Tear.</span> Damn me, we must kill all those rogues: we shall never keep a

<p class="stage"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Welltried</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bold</span> <i>putting on his doublet</i>;
<span class="smcap">Feesimple</span> <i>asleep on a bed, as in</i> <span class="smcap">Bold's</span> <i>chamber</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> You see, we made bold with your lodging:
indeed, I did assure myself you were fast for this night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> But how the devil came this fool in your company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> 'Sfoot, man, I carried him last night among the roarers to flesh
him; and, by this light, he got drunk, and beat 'em all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Why, then he can endure the sight of a drawn sword now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> O God, sir, I think in my conscience he will eat steel shortly. I
know not how his conversion will hold after this sleep; but, in an hour
or two last night, he was grown such a little damn-me, that I protest I
was afraid of the spirit that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> myself had raised in him. But
this other matter&mdash;of your expulsion thus, mads me to the heart.
Were you in bed with her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> In bed, by heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> I'll be hanged, if you were not busy too
soon: you should have let her slept first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Zounds! man, she put her hand to my breasts, and swore I was no
maid: now I, being eager to prove her words true, took that hint, and
would violently have thrust her hand lower, when her thought, being
swifter than my strength, made her no sooner imagine that she was
betrayed, but she leaps out of the bed, whips me down a sword that hung
by, and, as if fortitude and justice had met to assist her, spite of all
argument, fair or foul, she forced me away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> But is it possible thou shouldst have no more wit? wouldst thou
come away upon any terms but sure ones, having night, her chamber, and
herself naked in thine arms? By that light, if I had a son of fourteen,
whom I had helped thus far, that had served me so, I would breech him.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> Have done? done? done twice at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Have played Tarquin, and ravished her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> Pish! Tarquin was a blockhead: if he had had any wit and could
have spoke, Lucrece had never been ravished; she would have yielded, I
warrant thee, and so will any woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> I was such an erroneous heretic to love and women as thou art,
till now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> God's precious! it makes me mad when I think on't. Was there ever
such an absurd trick! now will she abuse thee horribly, say thou <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> art a
faint-hearted fellow, a milksop, and I know not what, as indeed thou
art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bold.</span> Zounds! would you had been in my place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well.</span> Zounds! I would I had, I would have so jumbled her honesty.
Wouldst thou be held out at stave's end with words? dost thou not know a
widow's a weak vessel, and is easily cast, if you close.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> Very good; on, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> At the first she was horrible stiff against me; then, sir, I took
her by the hand, which I kissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> Good, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> And I called her pretty rogue, and I thrust my finger betwixt her
breasts, and I made lips. At last, I pulled her by the chin to me, and I
kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> Hum!&mdash;very good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> So at the first she kissed very strangely, close and untoward. Then
said I to her, think but upon the wrongs, the intolerable wrongs, the
rogue your husband does you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> Ay, that was very good: what said she to you then, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> Nay, I went on. First, quoth I, think how he hath used
you&mdash;left you no means, given all your clothes to his punks; struck
you, turned your grey eyes into black ones, but yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> A pretty conceit!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> Quoth I, these things are nothing in the rascal: think but what a
base whoremaster the rascal is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> Did you call me rascal so often, are you
sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> Yes, and oftener; for, said I, none comes amiss to the rogue. I
have known him, quoth I, do three lousy beggars under hedges in the
riding of ten mile, and I swore this too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hus.</span> 'Twas very well; but you did lie. On, pray.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sub.</span> Pish! one must lie a little. Now, sir, by this time she began to
kiss somewhat more openly and familiarly, her resistance began to
slacken, and my assault began to stiffen. The more her bulwark decayed,
the more my battery fortified. At last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span> sir, a little fumbling
being passed to make the conquest more difficult, she perceiving my
artillery<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> mounted, falls me flat upon her back, cries me out

<p>John Cook, the author of this play, is totally unknown. No contemporary
writer has taken the least notice of him, nor has any biographer since
given the slightest account of his life. All that we are informed of is,
that he wrote the following dramatic performance. Langbaine,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and the writers since,
ascribe the first title of it to the excellent performance of Thomas
Green in the part of Bubble, whose universal repartee to all compliments
is <i>Tu quoque</i>. Green was both a writer and actor,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and with great
probability<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> is supposed to have</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>been a relation of Shakespeare's, and the person by whom he was
introduced to the theatre. He was born at Stratford-upon-Avon, which is
ascertained by the following lines,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> spoken by him in one of the old
comedies, in the character of a clown:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <span class="i4">"I prattled poesy in my nurse's arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i4">And, born where late our swan of Avon sung,</span><br />

<p>This passage is quoted by Chetwood from the "Two Maids of Moreclack,"
where it is not to be found, though it seems to be a genuine extract;
and the writer, by whom it was produced, had perhaps forgotten whence he
transcribed it. Heywood, who published this play, says in the preface to
it:&mdash;"As for Master Greene, all that I will speak of him (and that
without flattery) is this: there was not an actor of his nature in his
time of better ability in performance of what he undertook, more
applauded by the audience, of greater grace at the court, or of more
general love in the city." From this preface it appears Green was dead
when it was written, and Oldys<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> says there are three epitaphs upon
him in Braithwaite's "Remains after Death," 1618, by which it seems that
he died after being newly arrived from sea.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> He was the author of "A
Poets Vision and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Princes Glorie. Dedicated to the high and
mightie Prince James, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,"
4&#176;, 1603; and some verses prefixed to [the reprint in octavo of]
Drayton's poem on the Barons' Wars. I have seen only two editions of
this comedy, one without a date, and the other in 1614, which I
apprehend was about the time it was originally published. Chetwood, upon
whom no dependence is to be had with respect to dates, asserts it was
printed in 1599.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> As it is said to have been acted by the Queen's
servants, it probably appeared on the stage in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. [There is an entry in the office-book of the Master of the
Revels under date of Twelfth Night, 1624, showing that "the masque being
put off,</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p> <p>and the Prince only there, "Tu Quoque," by the Queen
of Bohemia's servants, "was acted in its stead."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>] Langbaine
says it was revived after the Restoration at the theatre in Little
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</p>

<p>"Green's <em xml:lang="la">Tu Quoque</em>" is mentioned in "The World's Folly," by I. H., 1615,
which contains a general attack on the stage. It would also seem, from
the subsequent passage, as if Green the actor had performed the part of
a baboon:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em xml:lang="la">'Vos quoque</em>' *[or, '<em xml:lang="la">Tu quoque</em>,' opposite the asterisk in the margin]
and you also who, with Scylla-barking, Stentor-throated bellowings,
flash-choaking squibbles of absurd vanities into the nosthrils of your
spectators; barbarously diverting nature and defacing Gods owne image by
metamorphosing humane shape *[<i>Greenes Baboon</i> in the margin opposite
the asterisk] into bestiall forme."</p>

<h2><a name="TO_THE_READER_1" id="TO_THE_READER_1">TO THE READER</a></h2>

<p>To gratulate the love and memory of my worthy friend the author, and my
entirely beloved fellow the actor, I could not choose, being in the way
just when this play was to be published in print, but to prefix some
token of my affection to either in the frontispiece of the book. For the
gentleman that wrote it, his poem itself can better speak his praise
than any oratory from me. Nor can I tell whether this work was divulged
with his consent or no; but, howsoever, it hath passed the test of the
stage with so general an applause, pity it were but it should likewise
have the honour of the press. As for Master Green, all that I will speak
of him (and that without flattery) is this (if I were worthy to
censure), there was not an actor of his nature, in his time, of better
ability in performance of what he undertook, more applauded by the
audience, of greater grace at the court, or of more general love in the
city: and so with this brief character of his memory I commit him to his
rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> That I should live to be a servingman! a fellow which scalds
his mouth with another man's porridge; brings up meat for other men's
bellies, and carries away the bones for his own; changes his clean
trencher for a foul one, and is glad of it. And yet did I never live so
merry a life when I was my master's master as now I do, being man to my
man. And I will stand to't, for all my former speeches, a servingman
lives a better life than his master; and thus I prove it: The saying is,
the nearer the bone the sweeter the flesh; then must the servingman
needs eat the sweeter flesh, for he always picks the bones. And again,
the proverb says, the deeper the sweeter. There has the servingman the
advantage again, for he drinks still in the bottom of the pot. He fills
his belly, and never asks what's to pay; wears broadcloth, and yet dares
walk Watling Street,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> without any fear of his draper. And for his

<p>It is needful a gentleman should speak Latin sometimes, is it not,

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Why, then will I make use of that little I have upon times and
occasions. Here, Gervase, take this bag, and run presently to the
mercer's; buy me seven ells of horse-flesh-coloured taffata, nine yards
of yellow satin, and eight yards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> orange-tawny velvet. Then
run to the tailor's, the haberdasher's, the sempster's, the cutler's,
the perfumer's, and to all trades whatsoever, that belong to the making
up of a gentleman; and, amongst the rest, let not the barber be
forgotten: and look that he be an excellent fellow, and one that can
snap his fingers with dexterity.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> I shall fit you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Do so, good Gervase: it is time my beard were corrected, for it is
grown so saucy, as it begins to play with my nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Your nose, sir, must endure it; for it is in part the fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Is it in fashion? why, then my nose shall endure it, let it tickle
his worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Why, now y' are i' the right, sir; if you will be a true
gallant, you must bear things resolute. As thus, sir; if you be at an
ordinary, and chance to lose your money at play, you must not fret and
fume, tear cards, and fling away dice, as your ignorant gamester or
country-gentleman does; but you must put on a calm, temperate action,
with a kind of careless smile in contempt of fortune, as not being able
with all her engines to batter down one piece of your estate, that your
means may be thought invincible. Never tell your money: nor what you
have won, nor what you have lost. If a question be made, your answer
must be: What I have lost, I have lost; what I have won, I have won. A
close heart and free hand make a man admired: a testern or a shilling to
a servant that brings you a glass of beer, binds <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> his hands to
his lips: you shall have more service of him than his master; he will be
more humble to you than a cheater before a magistrate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Gervase, give me thy hand: I think thou hast more wit than I, that
am thy master; and for this speech only I do here create thee my
steward. I do long, methinks, to be at an ordinary: to smile at fortune,
and to be bountiful. Gervase, about your business, good Gervase, whilst
I go and meditate upon a gentleman-like behaviour. I have an excellent
gait already, Gervase, have I not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Hercules himself, sir, had never a better gait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> But despatch, Gervase: the satin and the velvet must be thought
upon, and the <i xml:lang="la">Tu quoque</i> must not be forgotten; for whensoever I give
arms, that shall be my motto.<br />

this gold here is my own, truly purchased: he has credit, and shall run
i' th' books for't. I'll carry things so cunningly, that he shall not be
able to look into my actions. My mortgage I have already got into my
hands: the rent he shall enjoy awhile, till his riot constrain him to
sell it; which I will purchase with his own money. I must cheat a
little: I have been cheated upon. Therefore I hope the world will a
little the better excuse me. What his uncle craftily got from me, I will
knavishly recover of him. To come by it, I must vary shapes, and my

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> I am, sir, a perfect traveller, that have trampled over the
face of the universe, and can speak Greek and Latin as promptly as my
own natural language. I have composed a book, wherein I have set down
all the wonders of the world that I have seen, and the whole scope of my
journeys, together with the miseries and lousy fortunes I have endured
therein.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> O Lord, sir, are you the man? give me your hand: how do ye? in good
faith, I think I have heard of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> No, sir, you never heard of me; I set this day footing upon the
wharf; I came in with the last peal of ordnance, and dined this day in
the Exchange amongst the merchants. But this is frivolous, and from the
matter: you do seem to be one of our gentile spirits that do affect
generosity: pleaseth you to be instituted in the nature, garb, and habit
of the most exactest nation in the world, the Italian? whose language is
sweetest, clothes neatest, and behaviour most accomplished. I am one
that have spent much money, and time, which to me is more dear than
money, in the observation of these things: and, now I am come, I will
sit me down and rest; and make no doubt but to purchase and build, by
professing this art or human science (as I may term it) to such
honourable and worshipful personages as mean to be peculiar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> This fellow has his tongue at his fingers' ends. But, hark ye, sir;
is your Italian the finest gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> In the world, signior; your Spaniard is a mere bumbard to him:
he will bounce, indeed, but he will burst. But your Italian is smooth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span> and lofty, and his language is cousin-german to the Latin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Why, then he has his <i xml:lang="la">Tu quoque</i> in his salute?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Yes, sir, for it is an Italian word as well as a Latin, and
enfolds a double sense; for one way spoken, it includes a fine
gentleman, like yourself; and another way it imports an ass, like whom
you will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> I would my man Gervase were here, for he understands these things
better than I. <span class="stageone">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> You will not serve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Serve! no, sir; I have talked with the great Sophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> I pray, sir, what's the lowest price of being Italianated?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Sir, if it please you, I will stand to your bounty: and, mark
me, I will set your face like a grand signior's, and you shall march a
whole day, until you come opunctly<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> to your mistress,
and not disrank one hair of your physiognomy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> I would you would do it, sir; if you will stand to my bounty, I
will pay you, as I am an Italian, <i xml:lang="la">Tu quoque</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Then, sir, I will first disburthen you of your cloak; you will
be the nimbler to practise. Now, sir, observe me: go you directly to the
lady to whom you devote yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> You shall set a good staid face upon the matter then. Your band
is not to your shirt, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> No, sir, 'tis loose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> It is the fitter for my purpose. I will first remove your hat.
It has been the fashion (as I have heard) in England to wear your hat
thus, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> in your eyes; but it is gross, naught, inconvenient, and
proclaims with a loud voice that he that brought it up first stood in
fear of serjeants. Your Italian is contrary: he doth advance his hat,
and sets it thus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Excellent well: I would you would set it on my head so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Soft; I will first remove your band, and set it out of the
reach of your eyes; it must lie altogether backward. So: your band is
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Is it as you would have it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> It is as I would wish; only, sir, this I

never to move your hat; but here, here is your courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub.</span> Nay, I warrant you; let me alone, if I perceive a thing once, I'll
carry it away. Now, pray, sir, reach my cloak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staines.</span> Never, whilst you live, sir.</p>

should remain of a person to whom the world is obliged for a performance
of so much merit as "Albumazar" is allowed to possess, cannot but create
surprise, and at the same time will demonstrate that genius is not
always sufficient to excite the attention of contemporaries or the
curiosity of posterity. Dryden [whose ignorance of our earlier
literature is well known] not only seems to have been unaware to whom
the world owed this piece, but also the time in which it was first
represented. He has without any authority asserted that Ben
Jonson&mdash;</p>

<p>But in this particular he was certainly mistaken. The "Alchemist" was
printed in 1612, and "Albumazar" was not performed until the year 1614,
as will appear from the following particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p>"King James," says a writer in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for May 1756,
p. 224, "made a progress to Cambridge" and other parts in the winter of
the year 1614, as is particularly taken notice of by Rapin, vol. ii. p.
156, who observes that the play called 'Ignoramus' was then acted before
his Majesty at Cambridge, and gave him infinite pleasure. I found in the
library of Sir Edward Deering a minute in manuscript of what passed at
Cambridge for the five days the king stayed there, which I shall here
transcribe, for it accords perfectly with the account given by the
historian, both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> the king's progress and the play entitled
"Ignoramus," and at the same time will afford us the best light to the
matter in hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On Tuesday the 7th of March 1614, was acted before the King, in Trinity
College Hall&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Æmilia: A Latin Comedy, made by Mr Cecill Johannis.</p>

<p>"On Wednesday night&mdash;</p>

<p>"2. Ignoramus the Lawyer<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>: Latine and part English.
Composed by Mr Ruggle Clarensis.</p>

<p>"On Thursday&mdash;</p>

<p>"3. Albumazar the Astronomer, in English. By Mr
Tomkis, Trinit.</p>

<p>"On Friday&mdash;</p>

<p>"4. Melanthe<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>: A Latin Pastoral. Made by Mr [S.]
Brookes (mox doctor) Trinitatis.</p>

<p>"On the next Monday&mdash;</p>

<p>"5. The Piscatory, an English Comedy, was acted
before the University, in King's College, which Master
Fletcher<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> of that College had provided, if the King
should have tarried another night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Part of the above account is confirmed in a letter from John Chamberlain
to Sir Dudley Carlton, at Turin, dated 16th March 1614, lately printed
in "Miscellaneous State Papers, from 1501 to 1726," i. 395: "The King
and Prince lay at Trinity College, where the plays were represented; and
the hall so well ordered for room, that above 2000 persons were
conveniently placed. The first night's entertainment was a comedy, and
acted by St John's men, the chief part consisting of a counterfeit Sir
Edward Ratcliffe, a foolish tutor of physic, which proved but a lean
argument; and, though it were larded with pretty shows at the beginning
and end, and with somewhat too broad speech for such a presence, yet it
was still dry. The second night was a comedy of Clare Hall, with the
help of two or three good actors from other houses, wherein David
Drummond, in a hobby-horse, and Brakin the recorder of the town, under
the name of Ignoramus,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> a common lawyer, bare great parts.
The thing was full of mirth and variety, with many excellent actors
(among whom the Lord Compton's son, <a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> though least,
was not worst), but more than half marred with extreme length. The third
night was an English comedy called <span class="smcap">Albumazar</span>, of Trinity College's
action and invention; but there was no great matter in it, more than one
good clown's part. The last night was a Latin Pastoral, of the same
house, excellently written, and as well acted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> which gave great
contentment, as well to the King as to the rest."</p>

<p>After the Restoration, "Albumazar" was revived, and Mr Dryden wrote a
prologue to it, which is printed in every edition of his works.</p>

<p>Although it does not appear to have been upon the list of acting plays,
yet the reputation which it had obtained induced Mr Ralph to build upon
it a comedy which, after ten years' application, was performed at Drury
Lane in 1744, under the title of "The Astrologer." It was acted,
however, only one night, when the receipts of the house amounted but to
twenty-one pounds. On the second night, the manager was obliged to shut
up his doors for want of an audience. (See advertisement prefixed to the
play.)</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that "Albumazar" has not been a favourite play with
the people in general. About the year 1748, soon after Mr Garrick became
manager of Drury Lane Theatre, he caused it to be revived, and gave it
every advantage which could be derived from the assistance of the best
performers; but though admirably acted, it does not appear to have met
with much success. It was again revived at the same theatre in 1773,
with some alterations, and was again coldly received, though supported
by the best comic performers of the times. The piece, on this revival,
received some alterations from the pen of Mr Garrick, and was published
in 8<sup>o</sup>, 1773.</p>

<p class="stage"><span class="smcap">Trincalo</span>, <span class="smcap">Armellina</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> He that saith I am not in love, he lies <i>de cap-a-pie</i>; for I am
idle, choicely neat in my clothes, valiant, and extreme witty. My
meditations are loaded with metaphors, songs, and sonnets; not a cur
shakes his tail but I sigh out a passion:<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
thus do I to my mistress; but, alas! I kiss the dog, and she kicks me. I
never see a young wanton filly, but say I, there goes Armellina; nor a
lusty strong ass, but I remember myself, and sit down to consider what a
goodly race of mules would inherit, if she were willing: only I want
utterance&mdash;and that's a main mark of love too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> Trincalo, Trincalo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> O, 'tis Armellina! Now, if she have the wit to begin, as I mean
she should, then will I confound her with compliments drawn from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>plays I see at the Fortune and Red Bull,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> where
I learn all the words I speak and understand not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> Trincalo, what price bears wheat and
saffron, that your band's so stiff and yellow?<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>not a word? Why, Trincalo, what business in town? how do all at Totnam?
grown mute? What do you bring from the country?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> There 'tis. Now are my floodgates drawn, and I'll surround her.
[<i>Aside.</i>] What have I brought? sweet bit of beauty, a hundred thousand
salutations o' th' elder-house to your most illustrious honour and
worship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> To me these titles! Is your basket full of nothing else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> Full of the fruits of love, most resplendent lady: a present to
your worthiness from your worship's poor vassal Trincalo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> My life on't, he scrap'd these compliments
from his cart the last load he carried for the progress.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
What ha' you read, that makes you grow so eloquent?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> Sweet madam, I read nothing but the lines of your ladyship's
countenance; and desire only to kiss the skirts of your garment, if you
vouchsafe me not the happiness of your white hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> Come, give's your basket, and take it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> O, sweet! now will I never wash my mouth after, nor breathe but at
my nostrils, lest I lose the taste of her finger. Armellina, I must tell
you a secret, if you'll make much on't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> As it deserves. What is't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> I love you, dear morsel of modesty, I love; and so truly, that
I'll make you mistress of my thoughts, lady of my revenues, and commit
all my movables into your hands; that is, I'll give you an earnest kiss
in the highway of matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arm.</span> Is this the end of all this business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> This is the end of all business, most beautiful, and
most-worthy-to-be-most beautiful, lady.</p>

<span class="alignright">[<i>Exit.</i></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trin.</span> Why, now she knows my meaning, let it work. She put up the fruit in
her lap, and threw away the basket: 'tis a plain sign she abhors the
words, and embraces the meaning.</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Sul.</span> Then 'tis the love of a young gentleman,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And bitter hatred of an old dotard.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fla.</span> 'Tis so. Witness your brother Eugenio, and the rotten carcase of
Pandolfo. Had I a hundred hearts, I should want room to entertain his
love and the other's hate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sul.</span> I could say as much, were't not sin to slander the dead. Miserable
wenches! How have we offended our fathers, that they should make us the
price of their dotage, the medicines of their griefs, that have more
need of physic ourselves? I must be frostbitten with the cold of your
dad's winter, that mine may thaw his old ice with the spring of your
sixteen. I thank my dead mother, that left me a woman's will in her last
testament. That's all the weapons we poor girls can use, and with that
will I fight 'gainst father, friends, and kindred, and either enjoy
Lelio, or die in the field in his quarrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fla.</span> Sulpitia, you are happy that can withstand your fortune with so
merry a resolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sul.</span> Why should I twine mine arms to cables,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
and sigh my soul to air? Sit up all night like a watching-candle,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
and distil my brains through my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>eyelids. Your brother loves me,
and I love your brother; and where these two consent, I would fain see a
third to hinder us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fla.</span> Alas! our sex is most wretched, nursed up from infancy in continual
slavery. No sooner able to prey for ourselves, but they brail and hud
us<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> so with sour awe of parents, that we dare not offer to bate<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
at our own desires. And whereas it becomes men to vent their amorous
passions at their pleasure, we (poor souls) must rake up our affections
in the ashes of a burnt heart, not daring to sigh without excuse of the
spleen or fit of the mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sul.</span> I plainly will profess my love of Lelio. 'Tis honest, chaste, and
stains not modesty. Shall I be married to Antonio, that hath been a
soused sea-fish these three months? And if he be alive, comes home with
as many impairs as a hunting gelding or a fallen pack-horse. No, no;
I'll see him freeze to crystal first. In other things, good father, I am
your most obedient daughter, but in this a pure woman. 'Tis your part to
offer&mdash;mine to refuse, if I like not. Lelio's a handsome gentleman,
young, fresh, rich, and well-fashioned; and him will Sulpitia have, or
die a maid. And, i' faith, the temper of my blood tells me I never was
born to so cold a misfortune. Fie, Flavia! fie, wench! [labour] no more
with tears and sighs; cheer up. Eugenio, to my knowledge, loves you, and
you shall have him; I say, you shall have him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fla.</span> I doubt not of his love, but know no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
means how he dares work against so great a rival. Your father, in a
spleen, may disinherit him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sul.</span> And give't to whom? H' has none but him and me. What though he doat
awhile upon your beauty, he will not prove unnatural to his son. Go to
your chamber. My genius whispers in my ear, and swears this night we
shall enjoy our loves, and with that hope farewell.</p>

sworn th' had cheated: but, fie! 'tis base and clownish to suspect, and
['tis] a gentleman's freeness to part with a cast suit. Now to the
business: I'll into my own house, and first bestow Armellina upon
Trincalo; then try what can be done for Pandolfo: for 'tis a rule I want
t' observe, first do your own affairs, and next your master's. This word
master makes me doubt I am not changed as I should be. But all's one:
I'll venture, and do something worthy Antonio's name while I have it.</p>

The title-page of it says it was divers times publicly acted by certain
London Prentices; and Sir Henry Wotton<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>, in a letter to Sir Edmund
Bacon, dated 1612-13, gives the following account of its first
performance: "On Sunday last at night, and no longer, some sixteen
Apprentices (of what sort you shall guess by the rest of the Story),
having secretly learnt a new play without book, intituled, <cite>The Hog hath
lost His Pearl</cite>; took up the <cite>White Fryers</cite> for their Theater: and
having invited thither (as it should seem) rather their Mistresses than
their Masters, who were all to enter <em class="italic">per buletini</em> for a note of
distinction from ordinary Comedians. Towards the end of the Play, the
sheriffs (who by chance had heard of it) came in (as they say) and
carried some six or seven of them to perform the last Act at <em class="italic">Bridewel</em>;
the rest are fled. Now it is strange to hear how sharp-witted the City
is, for they will needs have Sir <em class="italic">John Swinerton</em>, the Lord Major, be
meant by the <em class="italic">Hog</em>, and the late Lord Treasurer by the <em class="italic">Pearl</em>."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

vouchsafe to help me to the speech of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atlas.</span> We must first crave your oath, sir, that you come not with intent
to molest, perturb, or endanger him; for he is a gentleman, whom it hath
pleased fortune to make her tennis-ball of, and therefore subject to be
struck by every fool into hazard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> In that I commend thy care of him, for which friendship here's a
slight reward; tell him a countryman of his, one Lightfoot, is here,

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> So now I shall have a sight of my cousin gallant: he that hath
consumed £800 a year in as few years as he hath ears on his head: he
that was wont never to be found without three or four pair of red
breeches running before his horse or coach: he that at a meal hath had
more several kinds than, I think, the ark contained: he that was admired
by niters<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> for his robes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span> gallantry, and was indeed all that an elder brother might
be&mdash;prodigal; yet he, whose unthriftiness kept many a house, is now
glad to keep house in a house that keeps him, the poor tenant of a
porter. And see his appearance! I'll seem strange to him.</p>

all the way I came up, how much his company will credit me.</p>

next.</p>

 </div>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> O, by your versifying I know you now, sir: how dost? I knew thee
not at first, thou'rt very much altered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> Faith, and so I am, exceeding much since
you saw me last&mdash;about £800 a year; but let it
pass, for passage<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> carried away the most part of it:

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> Thou'st more need to pray to Fortune than curse her: she may be
kind to thee when thou art penitent: but that, I fear, will be never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> O, no, if she be a woman, she'll ever love those that hate her.
But, cousin, thou art thy father's first-born; help me but to some
means, and I'll redeem my mortgag'd lands, with a wench to boot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> As how, I pray thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> Marry thus: Hog the usurer hath one only daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> Is his name Hog? It fits him exceeding well; for as a hog in his
lifetime is always devouring, and never commodious in aught till his
death; even so is he, whose goods at that time may be put to many good
uses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> And so I hope they shall before his death. This daughter of his
did, and I think doth, love me; but I, then thinking myself worthy of an
empress, gave but slight respect unto her favour, for that her parentage
seemed not to equal my high thoughts, puffed up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> With tobacco, surely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> No; but with as bad a weed&mdash;vainglory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> And you could now be content to put your lofty spirits into the
lowest pit of her favour. Why, what means will serve, man? 'Sfoot, if
all I have will repair thy fortune, it shall fly at thy command.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> Thanks, good coz, the means shall not be great, only that I may
first be clad in a generous outside, for that is the chief attraction
that draws female affection. Good parts, without habiliments of
gallantry, are no more set by in these times than a good leg in a
woollen stocking. No, 'tis a glistering presence and audacity brings
women into fool's felicity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

outside shall effect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> That being had, we'll to the usurer, where you shall offer some
slight piece of land to mortgage, and if you do it to bring ourselves
into cash, it shall be ne'er the farther from you, for here's a project
will not be frustrate of this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> That shall be shortly tried. I'll instantly go seek for a habit
for thee, and that of the richest too; that which shall not be subject
to the scoff of any gallant, though to the accomplishing thereof all my
means go. Alas! what's a man unless he wear good clothes?<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Hog.</span> But is it possible your sister should be stolen? sure, some of the
household servants were confederates in't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Y. Lord W.</span> Faith, I think they would have confessed, then; for I am sure
my lord and father hath put them all to the bastinado twice this morning
already: not a waiting-woman, but has been stowed, i' faith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P. Ser.</span> Trust me, he says well for the most part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hog.</span> Then, my lord, your father is far impatient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Y. Lord W.</span> Faith, and so she may, for 'tis long ere I can get up, when I
go foxed to bed. But, Peter, has she no other suitors besides myself?</p>

parcels of men's flesh would look, when I had caught the bird which they

<p><span class="smcap">Reb.</span> Of what, I pray, you impudence? This fellow will go near to take
his oath that he hath seen us plight faiths together; my father keeps
him for no other cause than to outswear the truth. My lord, not to hold
you any longer in a fool's paradise, nor to blind you with the hopes I
never intend to accomplish, know, I neither do, can, or will love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Y. Lord W.</span> How! not love a lord? O indiscreet young woman! Indeed, your

will ask more shaking before they fall than those that are; and my
conquest will seem the greater still.<br />

am a lord, I never knew the meaning on't till yesterday. Malapert, my
father's butler, being a witty jackanapes, told me why it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reb.</span> By'r Lady, my lord, 'twas a shrewd study, and I fear hath altered
the property of your good parts; for, I'll assure you, I loved you a

<p><span class="smcap">Y. Lord W.</span> Nay, 'tis all one, whether you do or no: 'tis but a little
more trouble to bring ye about again; and no question, but a man may
do't, I am he. 'Tis true, as your father said, the black ox hath not

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> By this light, coz, this suit does rarely! The tailor that made it
may hap to be saved, an't be but for his good works: I think I shall be
proud of 'em, and so I was never yet of any clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> How! not of your clothes? why then you were never proud of
anything, for therein chiefly consisteth pride; for you never saw pride
pictured but in gay attire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> True; but, in my opinion, pride might as well be portrayed in any
other shape, as to seem to be an affecter of gallantry, being the causes
thereof are so several and divers. As, some are proud of their strength,
although that pride cost them the loss of a limb or two by over-daring;
likewise, some are proud of their humour, although in that humour they
be often knocked for being so; some are proud of their drink, although
that liquid operation cause them to wear a nightcap three weeks after;
some are proud of their good parts, although they never put them to
better uses than the enjoying of a common strumpet's company, and are
only made proud by the favour of a waiting-woman; others are
proud&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> Nay, I prythee, coz, enough of pride; but when do you intend to
go yonder to Covetousness the usurer, that we may see how near your plot
will take for the releasing of your mortgaged lands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> Why, now presently; and, if I do not accomplish my projects to a
wished end, I wish my fortunes may be like some scraping tradesman, that
never embraceth true pleasure till he be threescore and ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> But say Hog's daughter, on whom all your hopes depend, by this be
betrothed to some other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> Why, say she were; nay more, married to another, I would be ne'er
the farther from effecting my intents. No, coz, I partly know her inward
disposition; and, did I but only know her to be womankind, I think it
were sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> Sufficient for what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> Why, to obtain a grant of the best thing she had, chastity. Man,
'tis not here as 'tis with you in the country, not to be had without
father's and mother's goodwill; no, the city is a place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span> more traffic,
where each one learns by example of their elders to make the most of
their own, either for profit or pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light.</span> 'Tis but your misbelieving thoughts make you surmise so: if women
were so kind, how haps you had not by their favours kept yourself out of
the claws of poverty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Had.</span> O, but, coz, can a ship sail without water? had I had but such a
suit as this to set myself afloat, I would not have feared sinking. But

<h2><a name="FORMER_EDITION" id="FORMER_EDITION">INTRODUCTION TO THE FORMER EDITION.</a></h2>

<p>Thomas May was the son of Sir Thomas May, of Mayfield, in the county of
Sussex, Knight, a gentleman of an ancient and honourable family.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
He was born in the year 1595, and received his early education in the
neighbourhood of his birthplace; thence he was removed to Sidney-Sussex
College in Cambridge, and took the degree of B.A. in 1612. On the 6th of
August 1615, he was admitted into the society of Gray's-Inn, and soon
after became celebrated for his poetical performances.</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> with whom he was intimately acquainted, says "that
his father spent the fortune which he was born to, so that he had only
an annuity <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span> left him not proportionable to a liberal education;
yet, since his fortune could not raise his mind, he brought his mind
down to his fortune by a great modesty and humility in his nature, which
was not affected, but very well became an imperfection in his speech,
which was a great mortification to him, and kept him from entering upon
any discourse but in the company of his very friends. His parts of
nature and art were very good, as appears by his translation of Lucan
(none of the easiest work of that kind), and more by his Supplement to
Lucan which, being entirely his own, for the learning, the wit and the
language, may be well looked upon as one of the best epic poems in the
English language. He writ some other commendable pieces of the reign of
some of our kings. He was cherished by many persons of honour, and very
acceptable in all places; yet (to show that pride and envy have their
influences upon the narrowest minds, and which have the greatest
semblance of humility) though he had received much countenance, and a
very considerable donative from the king, upon his majesty's refusing to
give him a small pension,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> which he had designed and promised to
another very ingenious person, whose qualities he thought inferior to
his own, he fell from his duty and all his former friends, and
prostituted himself to the vile office<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> of celebrating the infamous
acts of those who were in rebellion against the king; which he did so
meanly, that he seemed to all men to have lost his wits when he left his
honesty, and shortly after died miserable and neglected, and deserves to
be forgotten."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>He died suddenly on the night of the 13th of November 1650, after having
drank his cheerful bottle as usual. The cause of his death is said to
have arisen from the tying of his nightcap too close under his chin,
which occasioned a suffocation when he turned himself about.</p>

<p>He was buried, by appointment of the Parliament, in a splendid manner,
in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey, where a monument to his memory
was erected, with a Latin inscription thereon, composed by Marchemont
Needham, which remained there until the Restoration, when it was
destroyed, and his body dug up, and buried in a large pit belonging to
St Margaret's Church, with many others who had been interred in the
abbey during the Interregnum.</p>

<p>He was the author of the following dramatic pieces&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "The Tragedy of Antigone the Theban princesse."
8<sup>o</sup>. 1631.</p>

<p>2. "The Heire: a Comedy: acted by the Company
of the Revels, 1620." 4<sup>o</sup>. 1633.</p>

<p>3. "The Tragedy of Julia Agrippina, Empress of
Rome." 12<sup>o</sup>. 1639. 12<sup>o</sup>. 1654.</p>

<p>4. "The Tragedy of Cleopatra, Queen of Ægypt."
12<sup>o</sup>. 1639. 12<sup>o</sup>. 1654.</p>

<p>5. "The Old Couple: a Comedy." 4<sup>o</sup>. 1658.</p>

<p>He also wrote "The reign of king Henry the Second," and "The victorious
reign of Edward the Third,"<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> both in English verse; and translated,
besides <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>Lucan, the "Georgics" of Virgil, the "Epigrams" of
Martial, the "Icon Animorum" by Barclay, and the verses in the "Argenis"
of the same author. He likewise was the author of "The History of the
Parliament of England, which began November 3, 1640, with a short and
necessary view of some precedent years." Folio. 1647.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>The following inscription<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> was made upon him by one of the Cavalier
party, which he had abused&mdash;</p>

  <span class="i0">The Heir being born, was in his tender age</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rock'd in the cradle of a private stage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where, lifted up by many a willing hand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The child did from the first day fairly stand;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since having gather'd strength, he dares prefer</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His steps into the public theatre&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The world: where he despairs not but to find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A doom from men more able, not less kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I but his usher am; yet, if my word</span><br />
  <span class="i0">May pass, I dare be bound he will afford</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Things must deserve a welcome, if well known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such as best writers would have wish'd their own.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You shall observe his words in order meet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, softly stealing on with equal feet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Slide into even numbers with such grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As each word had been moulded for that place.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You shall perceive an amorous passion, spun</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Into so smooth a web as, had the Sun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When he pursu'd the swiftly-flying maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Courted her in such language, she had stay'd:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A love so well express'd must be the same</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The author felt himself from his fair flame.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The whole plot doth alike itself disclose</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Through the five acts, as doth a lock, that goes</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With letters; for, till every one be known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The lock's as fast as if you had found none;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And, where his sportive Muse doth draw a thread</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of mirth, chaste matrons may not blush to read.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus have I thought it fitter to reveal</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My want of art (dear friend) than to conceal</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My love. It did appear I did not mean</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So to commend thy well-wrought comic scene,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As men might judge my aim rather to be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To gain praise to myself than give it thee;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though I can give thee none but what thou hast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deserv'd, and what must my faint breath outlast.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet was this garment (though I skill-less be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To take thy measure) only made for thee;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, if it prove too scant, 'tis 'cause the stuff</span><br />

or the witty knight Don Quixote de la Mancha, where those brave men,
whom neither enchantments, giants, windmills, nor flocks of sheep, could
vanquish, are made the trophies of triumphing love.</p>

go to a bawdy-house or so, is it not?</p>

are beholden to it. Alas! we must not fall in love, and choose whom we
like best; we have no jointures for them, as you blessed heirs can have.</p>

looks and carriage speak him worthy: besides, he is noble, his fortune's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span> sufficient, they both love each other. What can my father more
desire, that he gapes so after this old count, that comes for the
estate, as t'other, upon my soul, does not, but pure, spotless love? But
now his plot is for revenge upon his old enemy. Fie, fie! 'tis bloody
and unchristian; my soul abhors such acts. This match may rather
reconcile our houses, and I desire, where worth is, to have friendship
as, on my soul, 'tis there. Well, Philocles, I hope to call thee
brother. Somewhat I'll do. I'll go persuade Count Virro not to love her.
I know the way, and I'll but tell him truth&mdash;her brother lives;
that will cool his love quickly. But soft! here comes the count, as fit
as may be.</p>

<p class="stage"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Virro</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> She loves me not yet, but that's no matter. I shall have her; her
father says I shall, and I dare take his word. Maids are quickly
overruled. Ha, ha! methinks I am grown younger than I was by twenty
years. This fortune cast upon me is better than Medea's charm to make an
old man young again, to have a lord's estate freely bestowed, and with
it such a beauty as would warm Nestor's blood, and make old Priam lusty.
Fortune, I see thou lovest me now. I'll build a temple to thee shortly,
and adore thee as the greatest deity. Now, what are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> A poor scholar, my lord; one that am little beholding to fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> So are most of your profession. Thou shouldst take some more
thriving occupation. Be a judge's man; they are the bravest nowadays, or
a cardinal's pander&mdash;that were a good profession, and gainful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> But not lawful, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> Lawful! that cardinal may come to be pope, and then he could pardon
thee and himself too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> My lord, I was brought up a scholar, and I thank you for your
counsel, my lord: I have some for you, and therefore I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> For me! what, I prythee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> 'Tis weighty, and concerns you near.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> Speak, what is't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> No heir, my lord; her brother is alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> How! thou art mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> My lord, what I speak is true; and to my knowledge his father gives
it out in policy to marry his daughter the better; to hook in suitors,
and specially aimed at you, thinking you rich and covetous; and now he
has caught you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> But dost thou mock me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> Let me be ever miserable if I speak not truth: as sure as I am
here, Eugenio lives; I know it, and know where he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> Where, prythee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> Not a day's journey hence, where his father enjoined him to stay
till your match, and sends word to him of this plot: besides, I
overheard the old lord and his man Roscio laughing at you for being
caught thus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> Why, wert thou at the house then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eug.</span> Yes, but had scurvy entertainment, which I have thus revenged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vir.</span> Beshrew my heart, I know not what to think on't. 'Tis like enough:
this lord was always cunning beyond measure, and it amazed me that he
should grow so extreme kind to me on the sudden, to offer me all this.
Besides, this fellow is so confident, and on no ends of cosenage, that
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span> can see. Well, I would fain enjoy her&mdash;the wench is

I do? Now, brains, if ever you will, help your master.</p>

is a watchman? Secondly, what is the office of a watchman? For the
first, if any man ask me what is a watchman, I may answer him, he is a

by virtue of your office, commit him to prison, and then ask him whither
he was going.</p>

met him, and poisoned him.</p>

hands which always distinguished him (and without a single reference to
Field's unassisted comedies which, in fact, have remained unnoticed by
everybody), attributes to Field, in "The Fatal Dowry," all that he
thinks unworthy his notion of Massinger. We are to recollect, however,
that Field continued one of the Children of the Revels as late as 1609,
and that when "A Woman is a Weathercock" was printed in 1612, he must
have been scarcely of age.</p></div>

for the first time in Malone's Shakespeare, by Boswell, xxi. 395 and
404. One is subscribed "Your loving and obedient son," and the other
"Your loving son," and both request advances of money; the first on a
play, in the writing of which Field was engaged with Robert Daborne, and
the second, in consequence of Field having been "taken on an execution
of £30." They have no dates, but others with which they are found are in
1613.</p></div>

They are mentioned over and over again in old plays, as by Field himself
(probably) in "The Fatal Dowry," act iv. sc. 1: "There's a
shoulder-piece cut, and the base of a <em class="italic">pickadille</em> in <em class="italic">puncto</em>." A <em class="italic">pickadel</em>
is spoken of in "Northward Ho!" sig. D 3, as part of the dress of a
female. See Gifford's Ben Jonson, v. 55, for the origin and application
of the word.</p></div>

Armin's "Italian Taylor and his Boy," 1609. The Tailor in "Northward

Mary Ambree at the siege of Ghent, in 1584, are celebrated in a ballad
which goes by her name in Percy's "Reliques," ii. 239, edit. 1812. She
is mentioned by Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and many other dramatists; some of
whom were her contemporaries. Dr Percy conjectured that the "English
Mall" of Butler was the same female soldier, but he probably alluded to
Mall or Moll Cutpurse who forms a character in this play. Long Meg is
Long Meg of Westminster, also a masculine lady of great notoriety, and
after whom a cannon in Dover Castle, and a large flagstone in the
cloisters of Westminster Abbey are still called. Her life and "merry
pranks" were detailed in a pamphlet dated in [1582], and reprinted [from
a later edition] in 1816. It is conjectured that she was dead in 1594,
but she is often spoken of in our old writers. It will be seen by a
subsequent note that Long Meg was the heroine of a play which has not
survived.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> It is tolerably evident that two plays (one called "Long
Meg," and the other "The Ship"), and not one with a double title, are
here intended to be spoken of. This may seem to disprove Malone's
assertion ("Shakespeare" by Boswell, iii. 304), that only one piece was
represented on one day. By Henslowe's Diary it appears that "Longe Mege
of Westminster" was performed at Newington in February 1594, and,
according to Field, it must have continued for some time popular.
Nothing is known of a dramatic piece of that date called "The Ship." It
may have been only a jig, often given at the conclusion of plays.

lackeys or footmen at this period. R. Brathwaite, in his "Time's
Curtaine Drawne," 1621, speaking of the attendants of a courtier,
mentions "two <em class="italic">Irish</em> lacquies" as among them. The <em class="italic">dart</em> which,
according to this play, and Middleton and Rowley's "Faire Quarrel"
(edit. 1622), they carried, was perhaps intended as an indication of the
country from which they came, as being part of the accoutrements of the
native Irish: thus, in the description of the dumb show preceding act
ii. of "The Misfortunes of Arthur," we find the following passage:
"After which there came a man bareheaded with long black shagged hair
down to his shoulders, apparaled with an Irish jacket and shirt, having
an Irish dagger by his side and a <em class="italic">dart</em> in his hand" [iv. 279]. The

the "Faire Quarrel," where Compass uses the words <em class="italic">Tweak</em> and

picture of the manners of the day, that play possesses little to

decisions of the learned have been various; but the balance of evidence
is undoubtedly in favour of the opinion that Shakespeare made the

obliged to the kindness of Mr Steevens) is to be found in Stubbes's
"Anatomie of Abuses," 1595, p. 43. The reader will excuse the length of
the quotation. "But amongst many other fearful examples of Gods wrath
against pride, I would wish them to set before their eies the fearful
judgment of God showed upon a gentlewoman of Antwerpe of late, even the
27 of Maie, 1582, the fearful sound whereof is blowne through all the
world, and is yet fresh in every mans memory. This gentlewoman, being a
very rich merchantmans daughter, upon a time was invited to a bridal or
wedding, which was solemnised in that towne, against which day she made
great preparation for the pluming of herself in gorgeous aray: that as
her body was most beautiful, faire, and proper, so her attire in every
respect might be answerable to the same. For the accomplishment whereof,
she curled her haire, she died her lockes, and laid them out after the
best manner: she colloured her face with waters and ointments; but in no
case could she get any (so curious and dainty she was) that could
startch and set her ruffes and neckerchers to her minde: wherefore she
sent for a couple of laundresses, who did the best they could to please
her humors, but in any wise they could not: then fell she to sweare and
teare, to curse and ban, casting the ruffes under feete, and wishing
that the devill might take her when shee did weare any neckerchers
againe. In the meane time (through the sufferance of God) the devill
transforming himselfe into the shape of a young man, as brave and proper
as she in every point, in outward appearance, came in, faining himself
to be a woer or sutor unto her: and seeing her thus agonized, and in
such a pelting chafe, he demaunded of her the cause thereof, who
straight way told him (as women can conceal nothing that lieth upon
their stomacks) how she was abused in the setting of her ruffes; which
thing being heard of him, he promissed to please her mind, and so tooke
in hande the setting of her ruffes, which he performed to her great
contentation and liking; insomuch as she, looking herselfe in a glasse
(as the devill bad her) became greatly inamoured with him. This done,
the young man kissed her, in the doing whereof, hee writh her neck in
sunder, so she dyed miserably; her body being straight waies changed
into blew and black colours, most ugglesome to beholde, and her face
(which before was so amorous) became most deformed and fearfull to looke
upon. This being knowne in the cittie, great preparation was made for
her buriall, and a rich coffin was provided, and her fearfull body was
laid therein, and covered very sumptuously. Foure men immediately
assayed to lift up the corpes, but could not moove it; then sixe
attempted the like, but could not once stirre it from the place where it
stood. Whereat the standers by marvelling, caused the coffin to be
opened to see the cause thereof: where they found the body to be taken
away, and a blacke catte, very leane and deformed, sitting in the
coffin, setting of great ruffes, and frizling of haire, to the greate
feare and woonder of all the beholders."&mdash;<cite>Reed.</cite> [Stubbes was fond

So in Ben Jonson's "Epicæne," act i. sc. 1, it is said of Morose, "he
would have hanged a pewterer's <em class="italic">'prentice</em> on a <em class="italic">Shrove Tuesday's</em> riot,
for being o' that trade, when the rest were quit."</p>

<p>On <em class="italic">Shrove Tuesday</em> in the County of Sussex (and I suppose in many
others) apprentices are always permitted to visit their families or
friends, to eat pancakes, &amp;c. This practice is called <em class="italic">shroving</em>.
"Apollo Shroving" is the name of an old comedy, written by a
schoolmaster in Suffolk [William Hawkins], to be performed by his
scholars on <em class="italic">Shrove Tuesday</em>, Feb. 6, 1626-7.</p>

<p>See note 6 to "The Hog hath lost his Pearl," <em class="italic">post.</em> The custom in
London, I believe, is almost abolished; it is, however, still retained
in many parts of the kingdom. [See "Popular Antiquities of Great
Britain," by Hazlitt, i. 47, where it is said] that "at Newcastle upon
Tyne the great bell of St Nicholas' Church is tolled at twelve o'clock
at noon on this day; shops are immediately shut up, offices closed, and
all kinds of business ceases; a sort of little carnival ensuing for the
remaining part of the day." Again: the custom of frying pancakes (in
turning of which in the pan there is usually a good deal of pleasantry
in the kitchen) is still retained in many families in the north, but
seems, if the present fashionable contempt of old custom continues, not
likely to last another century. The apprentices whose particular holiday
this day is now called, and who are on several accounts so much
interested in the observation of it, ought, with that watchful jealousy
of their ancient rights and liberties (typified here by pudding and
play) which becomes young Englishmen, to guard against every
infringement of its ceremonies, and transmit them entire and
unadulterated to posterity! [A copious account of this subject will be
found in "Popular Antiquities of Great Britain," i. 37-54.]</p></div>

Ducarel observes, "at Lambeth Palace, where thirty poor persons are
relieved by an alms called the DOLE, which is given three times a week
to ten persons at a time, alternately; each person then receiving
upwards of two pounds weight of beef, a pitcher of broth, a half
quartern loaf, and twopence in money. Besides this <em class="italic">dole</em>, there are
always, on the days it is given at least thirty other pitchers, called
by-pitchers, brought by other neighbouring poor, who partake of the
remaining broth, and the broken victuals that is at that time
distributed. Likewise at Queen's College in Oxford, provisions are to

<p><a name="Footnote_175_175" id="Footnote_175_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_175_175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> The spirit of enterprise which had been raised and encouraged
in the reign of Elizabeth was extremely favourable to the reputation of
those adventurers who sought to mend their fortunes by encountering
difficulties of any kind in a foreign country. Stukeley and the Sherleys
appear to have been held in great estimation by the people in general.
The former was a dissolute wretch, born in Devonshire, who squandered
away his property in riot and debauchery; then left the kingdom, and
signalised his valour at the battle fought at Alcazar in Barbary, in
August 1578, where he was killed. See an account of him in a ballad,
published in Evans's "Collection," 1777, ii. 103; also the old play [by
Peele] entitled, "The Battle of Alcazar, with the death of Captain
Stukeley," 4°, 1594. Of the Sherleys there were three brothers, Sir
Anthony, Sir Robert, and Mr. Robert; Sir Anthony was one of those
gallant spirits who went to annoy the Spaniards in their West Indian
settlements during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He afterwards travelled
to Persia, and returned to England in the quality of ambassador from the
Sophy, in 1612. The next year he published an account of his travels. He
was by the emperor of Germany raised to the dignity of a count; and the
king of Spain made him admiral of the Levant Sea. He died in Spain after
the year 1630. Sir Robert was introduced to the Persian court by his
brother Sir Anthony; and was also sent ambassador from the Sophy to
James I., but did not arrive until the accession of his successor; when,
on his first audience with the king (February, 1626), the Persian
ambassador, then resident in England, in the king's presence, snatched
the letters which were brought by him out of his hands, tore them to
pieces, and struck him a blow on the face; at the same time declaring
him an impostor and the letters forgeries. Charles, being unable to
discover the truth of these charges, sent both the ambassadors back to
Persia, with another from himself; but all three died in the course of
the voyage. The eldest brother was unfortunate.</p></div>

act iii. sc. 2, refers to the same, and appears to repeat the identical
line, which is also introduced in "Love's Labour's Lost," act iii. sc.
1. Bishop Warburton observes that "amongst the country May-games there
was an hobby-horse which, when the puritanical humour of those times
opposed and discredited these games, was brought by the poets and
ballad-makers, as an instance of the ridiculous zeal of the sectaries"
(Note to "Hamlet.") See also Mr Steevens's note on the same passage.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">hobby-horse</em> was also introduced into the Christmas

of the Faction begun at Wisbich, by Fa. Edmonds, alias
Weston, a Jesuite," 1595, &amp;c., 4<sup>o</sup>, 1601, p. 7, is the following
passage: "He lifted up his countenance, as if a new
spirit had bin put into him, and tooke upon him to controll
and finde fault with this and that (<em class="italic">as the comming into the
hall of a hobby-horse in Christmas</em>), affirming that he would
no longer tolerate these and those so grosse abuses, but
would have them reformed."</p>

<p>Whatever the allusion in the text be, the same is also
probably made in Drue's "Dutchess of Suffolk," 1631&mdash;</p>

<p>If this conjecture is allowed to be founded in probability, the author
of "Albumazar" may have been John Tomkins, bachelor of music, who, Wood
says, "was one of the organists of St Paul's Cathedral, and <em class="italic">afterwards
gentleman of the Chapel Royal</em>, then in high esteem for his admirable
knowledge in the theoretical and practical part of his faculty. At
length, being translated to the celestial choir of angels, on the 27th
Sept. an. 1626, aged 52, was buried in the said cathedral." It may be
added that Phineas Fletcher, who wrote a play to be exhibited in the
same week with "Albumazar," celebrates his friend Tomkins's skill in
music as well as poetry.</p></div>

to excuse themselves by alleging the hard usage of their father Ishmael
who, being turned out of doors by Abraham, had the open plains and
deserts given him by God for his patrimony, with permission to take
whatever he could find there; and, on this account, they think they may,
with a safe conscience, indemnify themselves as well as they can, not
only on the posterity of Isaac, but also on everybody else; always
supposing a sort of kindred between themselves and those they plunder.
And in relating their adventures of this kind, they think it sufficient
to change the expression, and, instead of <em class="italic">I robbed a man of such or
such a thing</em>, to say, <em class="italic">I gained it</em>. We must not, however, imagine that
they are the less honest for this among themselves, or towards those
whom they receive as friends; on the contrary, the strictest probity is
observed in their camp, where everything is open, and nothing ever known
to be stolen."</p></div>

on the subject of magic. Apollonius was born at Tyana about the time our
Saviour appeared in the world. He died at the age of near or quite 100
years, in the reign of Nerva. By the enemies of Christianity he was
reported to have worked miracles in the same manner as the Founder of
our religion, and in the works of Dr Henry More is inserted a parallel
between them. The degree of credit which the pagan miracles are entitled
to is very clearly shown in Dr Douglas's learned work, entitled, "The
Criterion, or Miracles Examined," 8<sup>o</sup>, 1757, p. 53. See a further
account of Apollonius in Blount's translation of "The Two First Books of

19, 1564, according to some writers, at Pisa, but more probably at
Florence. While professor of mathematics at Padua, he was invited by
Cosmo the Second, Duke of Tuscany, to Pisa, and afterwards removed to
Florence. During his residence at the latter place, he ventured to
assert the truth of the Copernican system; which gave so much offence to
the Jesuits that, by their procurement, he was ever after harassed by
the Inquisition. He suffered very frequent and long imprisonments on
account of his adherence to the opinions he had formed, and never
obtained his liberty without renouncing his sentiments, and undertaking
not to defend them either by word or writing. His assiduity in making
discoveries at length proved fatal to him. It first impaired his sight,
and at length totally deprived him of it. He died at Arcetre, near
Florence, January 8, 1642, N. S., in the 78th year of his age, having
been for the last three years of his life quite blind. See a comparison
between him and Bacon in Hume's "History of England," vi. 133, 8<sup>o</sup>,

bands washed and dyed with <em class="italic">yellow starch</em>. The inventress of them was
Mrs Turner, a woman of an infamous character; who, being concerned in
the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, was executed at Tyburn in a lawn ruff
of her favourite colour. "With her," says Howell, in his "Letters," p.
19, edit. 1754, "I believe that yellow starch, which so much disfigured
our nation, and rendered them so ridiculous and fantastic, will receive
its funeral." And of the same opinion was Sir Simonds D'Ewes who, in
[his "Autobiography," edit. Halliwell, p. 79], says, "Mrs Turner had
first brought upp that vaine and foolish use of <em class="italic">yellow starch,</em> ... and
therefore, when shee was afterwards executed at Tiburne, the hangman had
his <em class="italic">bande</em> and cuffs of the same couler, which made many, after that
day, of either sex, to forbeare the use of that <em class="italic">coulered starch</em>, till
at last it grew generallie to bee detested and disused." This execution
happened in the year 1615; but the reformation predicted by Howell, and
partly asserted by D'Ewes to have happened, was not the consequence, as
will appear from the following passage, extracted from a pamphlet called
"The Irish Hubbub, or the English Hue and Crie," by Barnaby Rich,
4<sup>o</sup>, 1622, p. 40: "Yet the open exclamation that was made by Turner's
wife at the houre of her death, in the place where shee was executed,
cannot be hidden, when, before the whole multitude that were there
present, she so bitterly protested against the vanitie of those <em class="italic">yellow
starcht bands</em>, that her outcries (as it was thought) had taken such
impression in the hearts of her hearers, that <em class="italic">yellow starcht bands</em>
would have been ashamed (for ever after to have shewed themselves about
the neckes, either of men that were wise, or women that were honest) but
we see our expectations have failed us, for <em class="italic">they beganne even then to
be more generall than they were before</em>." Again, p. 41: "You knowe
tobacco is in great trading, but you shall be merchants, and onely for
egges: for whereas one pipe of tobacco will suffice three or four men at
once; now ten or twenty eggs will hardly suffice to starch one of these
<em class="italic">yellow bands</em>: a fashion that I thinke shortly will be as conversant
amongst taylors, tapsters, and tinkers, as now they have brought
tobacco. But a great magistrate, to disgrace it, enjoyned the hangman of
London to become one of that fraternitie, and to follow the fashion;
and, the better to enable him, he bestowed of him some benevolence to
pay for his laundry: and who was now so briske, with a yellow feather in
his hat, and a <em class="italic">yellow starcht band</em> about his necke, walking in the
streets of London, as was master hangman? so that my young masters, that
have sithence fallen into that trimme, they doe but imitate the
hangman's president, the which, how ridiculous a matter it is, I will
leave to themselves to thinke on." And that the fashion prevailed some
years after Mrs Turner's death may be proved from Sir Simon D'Ewes's
relation of the procession of King James from Whitehall to the
Parliament House, Westminster, 30th January 1620 [<i>i.e.</i>, 1621]: "In the
king's short progresse from Whitehall to Westminster, these passages
following were accounted somewhat remarkable&mdash;And fourthlie, that,
looking upp to one window, as he passed, full of gentlewomen or ladies,
all in <em class="italic">yellow bandes</em>, he cried out aloud, 'A pox take yee, are yee
ther?' at which, being much ashamed, they all withdrew themselves
suddenlie from the window."</p></div>

<p>This privilege in the crown was continued until the civil wars in the
reign of Charles the First, and had been exercised in a manner very
oppressive to the subject, insomuch that it frequently became the object
of Parliamentary complaint and regulation. During the suspension of
monarchy it fell into disuse, and King Charles II at the Restoration
consented, for a consideration, to relinquish this as well as all other
powers of purveyance and pre-emption. Accordingly, by stat. 12, Car. II.
c. xxiv. s. 12, it was declared that no officer should in future take
any cart, carriage, or other thing, nor summon or require any person to
furnish any horses, oxen, or other cattle, carts, ploughs, wains, or
other carriages, for any of the royal family, without the full consent
of the owner. An alteration of this act was made the next year, wherein
the rates were fixed which should be paid on these occasions, and other
regulations were made for preventing the abuse of this prerogative.</p></div>

<p>Upon which Dr Grey has this note: "Mr Ray observes ('English Proverbs,'

comes from <em class="italic">spica</em>, an ear of corn: but rather, says he, as I am
informed from a better author, <em class="italic">spike</em> is a sort of <em class="italic">nail</em>, and <em class="italic">spawn</em>
the <em class="italic">chip</em> of a boat; so that it is all one as to say, every <em class="italic">chip</em> and
<em class="italic">nail</em> is new. But I am humbly of opinion that it rather comes from
<em class="italic">spike</em>, which signifies a <em class="italic">nail</em>, and a <em class="italic">nail</em> in measure is the 16th
part of a yard; and <em class="italic">span</em>, which is in measure a quarter of a yard, or
nine inches; and all that is meant by it, when applied to a new suit of
clothes, is that it has been just measured from the piece by the <em class="italic">nail</em>
and <em class="italic">span</em>." See the expression in Ben Jonson's "Bartholomew Fair," act
iii. sc. 5. [See Nares, edit. 1859; Hazlitt's "Proverbs," 1869; and

<p><a name="Footnote_314_314" id="Footnote_314_314"></a><a href="#FNanchor_314_314"><span class="label">[314]</span></a> The late ingenious Mr Robert Dodsley, whose modest
merit is well known to those who were acquainted with him, had little
skill in our ancient language, and therefore permitted many uncommon
terms to be exchanged for others, to the no small detriment of the
scenes which he undertook to publish. We had here a proof of the
unpardonable licence, where a word of no meaning, <em class="italic">soak</em>, was given
instead of a technical term belonging to falconry, in the language of
which the present metaphor is carried on. A young hawk, like a young
deer, was called a <em class="italic">soar</em> or <em class="italic">soare</em>: so that the brown <em class="italic">soar</em> feathers
are the remains of its first plumage, or such feathers as resemble it in
colour. These birds are always mewed while they were moulting, to
facilitate the growth of fresh plumes, more strong and beautiful than
those which dropped off. Without this restoration and explanation, the
passage before us is unintelligible.&mdash;<cite>Steevens.</cite></p>

<p>Latham, in his book of falconry, says: "A <em class="italic">sore hawke</em>, is from the
first taking of her from the eiry, till she have mewed her feathers."
The error introduced into the play by Mr Dodsley is continued by Mr
Garrick who, in his alteration, reads brown <em class="italic">soak</em> feathers.</p>

<p>Trincalo has already used a phrase that seems to be equivalent, in act
ii. sc. 4, where he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"But if I <em class="italic">mew</em> these <em class="italic">flags of yeomanry</em></span><br />
  <span class="i2">Gild in the <em class="italic">sear</em>," &amp;c.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>

<p>See the explanatory notes, where <em class="italic">flags</em> are called "the baser order of
feathers," and <em class="italic">sear</em>, we are told, is "the yellow part between the beak
and the eyes of the hawk." After all, <em class="italic">sear</em> may be a misprint for
<em class="italic">soar</em>, and this would make the resemblance in the two passages the
stronger.&mdash;<cite>Collier.</cite></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_315_315" id="Footnote_315_315"></a><a href="#FNanchor_315_315"><span class="label">[315]</span></a> The metaphor is taken from a cock, who in his pride
<em class="italic">prunes himself</em>, that is, picks off the loose feathers to smooth the
rest. See notes by Dr Johnson and Mr Steevens to "First Part of King
Henry IV.," act i. sc. 1.</p>

<p>The previous metaphors and phrases are from <em class="italic">falconry</em>, and probably the
allusion is meant to be continued here: a <em class="italic">hawk</em> may be said to <em class="italic">prune

the lesser ile of Great Brittaine. It is more than this, the whole
world's map, which you may here discerne in it's perfect'st motion,
justling and turning. It is a heape of stones and men, with a vast
confusion of languages; and, were the steeple not sanctified, nothing
liker Babel. The noyse in it is like that of bees, a strange humming or
buzze, mixt of walking, tongues, and feet. It is a kind of still roare,
or loud whisper. It is the great exchange of all discourse, and no
busines whatsoever but is here stirring and afoot. It is the synod of
all pates politicke, joynted and laid together in the most serious
posture; and they are not halfe so busie at the Parliament. It is the
anticke of tailes to tailes, and backes to backes, and for vizards, you
need goe no further than faces. It is the market of young lecturers,
whom you may cheapen here at all rates and sizes. It is the generall
mint of all famous lies, which are here, like the legends popery first
coyned and stampt in the church. All inventions are emptyed here, and
not few pockets. The best signe of a temple in it is, that it is the
theeves sanctuary, which robbe more safely in the croud then a
wildernesse, whilst every searcher is a bush to hide them. It is the
other expence of the day, after playes, taverne, and a baudy house, and
men have still some oathes left to sweare here. It is the eares
brothell, and satisfies their lust and ytch. The visitants are all men,
without exceptions; but the principall inhabitants and possessors are
stale knights, and captaines out of service; men of long rapiers and
breeches, which after all turne merchants here, and trafficke for newes.

a play called "Shore." See Malone's Shakespeare, xxi. p. 4, edit.

to Henslowe, was performed at Newington by the Lord Admiral's and Lord
Chamberlain's men, the 14th February 1594; and a ballad on the same
subject was entered on the Stationers' books in the same year. Meg of
Westminster is mentioned in "The Roaring Girl."&mdash;<cite>Gilchrist</cite>.</p>

<p>The play of "Long Meg" is mentioned in Field's "Amends for Ladies,"
1618, with another called "The Ship," as being played at the Fortune
theatre. Feesimple says, "Faith, I have a great mind to see 'Long Meg'
and 'The Ship' at the Fortune," which would seem to show in opposition
to Mr Malone's opinion (see Malone's Shakespeare by Boswell, iii. 304),
that more than one piece was played on the same occasion. Long Meg of
Westminster's "pranks" were detailed in a tract published in [1582], and
reprinted in the "Miscellanea Antiqua Anglicana." The introduction
contains some further notices of this conspicuous
damsel.&mdash;<cite>Collier</cite>.</p></div>

was very successful, though it is not easy to explain the allusion.
Dekker, in his "If it be not good, the Devil is in it," seems to refer
to the same piece to nearly the same purpose. Scumbroth observes, "No,
no, if fortune favoured me, I should be full; but fortune favours nobody
but garlick, nor garlick neither now, yet she hath strong reason to love
it; for though garlick made her smell abominably in the nostrils of the
gallants, yet she had smelt and stunk worse but for garlick." It may be,
that such a play was produced at the Fortune theatre, and met with
general approbation.</p>

<p>This conjecture is supported by the following passage from "The World's
Folly; or, A Warning-Peece Discharged upon the Wickedness thereof," by
I. H., 1615: "I will not particularize those <i xml:lang="la">blitea dramata</i>, (as

Ideots, whose garbe is the Tootheache of witte, the Plague-sore of

been taken from Lord Stirling's "Aurora," 4<sup>o</sup>, 1604, sig. K 4. One of
the triumvirate, Pope, Gay, or Arbuthnot, but which of them is not
known, in a piece printed in Swift's "Miscellanies," may have been
indebted for the same thought to either Lord Stirling or the present
writer.</p>

<p>Since this note was written, I find nothing was more common than these
answers of echoes in the works of contemporary and earlier writers. Many
instances might be produced. Amongst others, those who can be pleased
with such kind of performances may be referred to Sir P. Sidney's
"Arcadia," or Lodge's "Wounds of Civil War," 1594, act iii. The folly of
them is admirably ridiculed by the author of "Hudibras."&mdash;<cite>Reed</cite>.</p></div>

1634, p. 126, gives the following account of the origin of this term:
"As this Lady (<i>i.e.</i>, Rowena) was very beautiful, so was she of a very
comely deportment, and Hingistus, having invited King Vortiger to a
supper at his new-builded castle, caused that after supper she came
foorth of her chamber into the King's presence, with a cup of gold
filled with wine in her hand, and making in very seemly manner a low
reverence unto the King, sayd, with a pleasing grace and countenance, in
our ancient language, <em class="italic">Waes heal hlaford Cyning</em>, which is, being rightly
expounded according to our present speech, <em class="italic">Be of health, Lord King</em>, for
as <em class="italic">was</em> is our verbe of the preterimperfect tense, or preterperfect
tense, signifying <em class="italic">have bin</em>, so <em class="italic">was</em> being the same verb in the imperative
mood, and now pronounced <em class="italic">wax</em>, is as much as to say <em class="italic">grow</em>, <em class="italic">be</em>, or <em class="italic">become</em>;
and <em class="italic">waes-heal</em>, by corruption of pronunciation, afterwards became to be
<em class="italic">wassaile</em>. The King not understanding what shee said, demaunded it of his
chamberlaine, who was his interpreter, and when he knew what it was, he
asked him how he might againe answer her in her owne language, whereof
being informed, he sayd unto her <em class="italic">Drinc heal</em>, that is to say, <em class="italic">Drink
health</em>."&mdash;See also a note to "The Ordinary," in vol. xii.</p></div>

of excellent parts, and had spent many years of his youth in France and
Italy; and, returning from travel, followed the court, which the modesty
of that time disposed men to do sometime, before they pretended to be of
it; and he was very much esteemed by the most eminent persons in the
court, and well looked upon by the king himself, some years before he
could obtain to be sewer to the king; and when the king conferred that
place upon him, it was not without the regret even of the whole Scotch
nation, which united themselves in recommending another gentleman to it;
and of so great value were those relations held in that age, when
majesty was beheld with the reverence it ought to be. He was a person of
a pleasant and facetious wit, and made many poems, especially in the
amorous way, which, for the sharpness of the fancy, and the elegancy of
the language in which that fancy was spread, were at least equal, if not
superior, to any of that time; but his glory was, that after fifty years
of his life, spent with less severity or exactness than it ought to have
been, he died with the greatest remorse for that license, and with the
greatest manifestation of Christianity, that his best friends could
desire."&mdash;"Life of Clarendon," edit. 1759, i. 36. He died in the

the <em class="italic">bills</em> of tradesmen with the <em class="italic">bills</em> or arms formerly carried by
watchmen. Thus in [Munday's] curious old comedy, obviously translated
from the Italian, with some adaptations to English customs, called the
"Two Italian Gentlemen," we meet with the following
direction:&mdash;"Enter Fedele with Pedante, and with them two <em class="italic">watchmen
with bills</em>," act iv. sc. 5, sig. F 2.&mdash;<cite>Collier</cite>.</p></div>
